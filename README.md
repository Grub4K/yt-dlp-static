# yt-dlp-static

Experimental static musl libc builds for [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) binaries (see [releases](https://github.com/Grub4K/yt-dlp-static/releases))

## TODOs

There are some things left to do before we can use this upstream:

- [ ] Caching of base docker image
- [ ] Automated scheduled cache update
- [ ] Testing
